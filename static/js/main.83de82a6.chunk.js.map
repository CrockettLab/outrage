We might as well make some Almighty\n        mountains today as well, what the heck. In life you need colors.\n        Imagination is the key to painting. Isn't it great to do something you\n        can't fail at? Let that brush dance around there and play. Let's make a\n        happy little mountain now. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need\n        them to show the light.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic\n        dividends. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Look around, look\n        at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.\n        Let all these things just sort of happen. No pressure. Just relax and\n        watch it happen.\n      </p>\n    </section>\n    <section className={styles.section}>\n      <h2>About the Crockett Lab</h2>\n      <p>\n        And right there you got an almighty cloud.
